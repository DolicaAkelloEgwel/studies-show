Welcome to the Recollector. The ultimate tool for retrieving ANY article that's ever been made ever.

All you have to do is provide a year and a rough summary of what the article you are searching for is about. 

The Recollector will then go through its database to retrieve the article for you. It is even capable of retrieving articles from the future with some success. This is a highly experimental feature and should be used with caution (see Terms and Conditions).

As a result of the immensse work the Recollector does, you may have to wait a few minutes before your article is retrieved. But that's no big deal if it means you never lose an argument ever again, right?
